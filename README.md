# ReactJS with Redux Portfolio Site Client Front End
## Ben Greenberg


## About

This is a portfolio site front end built with ReactJS and Redux middleware. It was built specifically to display my portfolio site at http://www.bengreenberg.org.

## Installation

To use this frontend can use the 'create-react-app' cli in your terminal and then download the contents of this repository into your project directory. Running 'npm start' from the command line will initiate a localhost server running this frontend and will automatically load it in your default web browser.

This frontend assumes a relationship with an API to fetch the data for the site.
